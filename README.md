### working title: hop to it! (with a carrot as the !)
Sunday is Bun's favorite day of the week. Why? Well, because she gets to visit Grammy, of course!
</br>
In 'Hop to It,' you’ll play as Bun, helping Grammy tidy up the garden, fix a plumbing issue, and sort through a mountain of mail (but be sure to keep those grocery store coupons!). After all that hard work, you’ll have surely earned a slice of Grammy’s famous carrot cake!
